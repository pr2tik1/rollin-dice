## How to Play

Players take turns rolling a dice. Each roll adds to their current score. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and it becomes the next player's turn. Players can choose to hold, which adds their current score to their total score, and then it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game.
